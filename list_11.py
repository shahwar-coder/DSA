2. ğŸ§  Search Within a Sublist
Task:
Given a list of numbers, find the index of the number 9, but only consider elements between index 3 and 7 (inclusive of index 3, exclusive of 7).
If 9 is not found in that range, return "Missing".

# Example
nums = [1, 2, 9, 3, 9, 4, 5, 6]
# Output: 4  (since index 4 has 9, and it's between 3 and 7)

# Example
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Output: "Missing"
