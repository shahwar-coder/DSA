'''
ðŸ”· Building a Skeleton Menu System
Youâ€™re designing a command-line application with the following structure:

The menu has options: "1. Add", "2. Delete", "3. View", and "4. Exit".

Each option should be represented as a stub function (add(), delete(), view()) with pass inside them for now.

In the main loop, based on user input, the corresponding function should be called â€” but since they all have pass, nothing will happen inside yet.

ðŸ‘‰ Write this stub-based program that:

Accepts the user input.

Calls the correct function using if-elif-else.

Prints "Exiting..." and breaks the loop if the user enters "4".

ðŸ§  This tests your understanding of:

Using pass in real structural design.

Proper control flow with placeholder logic.

# âœ… This structure is a great scaffold for expanding the application later!
